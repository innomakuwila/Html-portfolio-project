## Travelling portfolio in CSS and HTML.

The purpose of this simple portfolio page is to showcase the skill i have in web development.
It features a single html file with inline CSS calls. 
It describes a little less **fictional** info about my adventurous nature lolðŸ˜‚


### Known issues
I tried to make the images enlarged when hovered over, but the implementation was not sucessful, but the thumbnails are still visible tho. **apologies for that**
otherwise, everything works as i left it.
